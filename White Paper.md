Token Allocation
Initial Sup: 420 million.
10% to minners  [2025 Update]
We have only Minted 21.72154% of the total supply. 
140M Team locked up for 4 years for Future developments.

$SHRK was  the first ZRC-2 token available on Zilswap.https://zilswap.io/swap  
$SHRK will start off as Universal ZRC-2 leverage exchange token that will create a future of frictionless arbitrage opportunities around the world, which in turn increases volume, that increases price.  
We can use this formula Volume+Efficiency+Fees = Price 
We then will Evolve and grow from the Aquarium of Interest.
we believe that investors around the world want a 10+ year stable investment.
that is fast and efficient they can transfer and hedge liquidity with less fees in less time seamlessly. 
this is why $SHRK runs on the robust backbone of Zilliqa’s blockchain to keep fees and friction to a minimum. 



APIs have replaced the whole paper process
      Digitalization & adoption of electronic payments

All funds are on the blockchain itself. This means that we do not control them. 


* We are committed to complete transparency *

Quantum Distributed ledger 
What we run on SCILLA
      Fin Tech

Being that $Shrk runs on the robust backbone of Zilliqa's blockchain and that they utilize shard networks,
$Shrk is able to process multiple transactions in a decentralized manner without a trusted coordinator through distributed ledger & Its network architecture allows the platform to remain decentralized as it continues to grow and expand with Lowest fees!



Fees are usually correlated with network congestion and transaction backlogs. The fee market in legacy chains can push the costs to as high as a few dollars. Due to the scaling ability,and low fees on Zilliqa’s chain, even allowing micro-payments to be processed fast and efficiently. 


What about Security?
 Fear Nothing!!

 $SHRK runs on Zilliqa’s silicon smooth blockchain, that is actively working with Chainlink for an added security layer of security on top of the most secure blockchain. 
So 
$Shrk swims fast and efficiently 
 your sharks are safe. 
 Your sharks are decentralized! 
 

$SHRK will swim in the wallets of the wealthiest 
Fast and Efficiently 
   


Establishing Price

looking at simple techniques to estimate the price for an asset. 
The more advanced economic mechanisms can open up new possibilities for the markets and can be very useful to let the market signal the price.
but that cannot apply in every scenario,considering we are in an evolving market  period 
 providers need to be able to set a reasonable price for their asset without a lot of information available to them.
With that being said! 

ROLES*
There are four key roles in the Fintech ecosystem:

Liquidity Providers * who are paid to provide liquidity

Swappers * who use the liquidity to swap assets paying fees

Traders * who monitor pools and rebalance continually, paying fees but with the intent to earn a profit.

Aribitors * Elite Traders that seek out price differences and maximize in proffits, also continuing to pay fees wile acquiring profit 


Disruption brings Opportunity!!

We will disrupt decentralized finance and become the influence!
