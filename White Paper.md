Establishing Price

looking at simple techniques to estimate the price for an asset. 
The more advanced economic mechanisms can open up new possibilities for the markets and can be very useful to let the market signal the price.
but that cannot apply in every scenario,considering we are in an evolving market  period 
 providers need to be able to set a reasonable price for their asset without a lot of information available to them.
With that being said! 

ROLES*
There are four key roles in the Fintech ecosystem:

Liquidity Providers * who are paid to provide liquidity

Swappers * who use the liquidity to swap assets paying fees

Traders * who monitor pools and rebalance continually, paying fees but with the intent to earn a profit.

Aribitors * Elite Traders that seek out price differences and maximize in proffits, also continuing to pay fees wile acquiring profit 

Disruption brings Opportunity!!

We will disrupt decentralized finance and become the influence!
