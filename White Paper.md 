Quantum Electronic Payment system 


 WHAT IS SHARK ?

$Shrk will be the native utility token for SharkCapital.

$SHRK Is Rare * 
The First Quantum Electronic Tamperproof Asset*
Initial Sup: 420 million. NO MORE 
Shrk was  the first ZRC-2 token available on Zilswap.https://zilswap.io/swap  
$SHKR will start of Universal ZRC-2 leverage exchange token that will create a future of frictionless arbitrage opportunities around the world, which in turn increases volume, that increases price  
 for stable 10 year private security investing opportunities.
We can use this formula Volume+Efficiency+Fees = Price Also a protocol to return the fees to the provider over a period of liquidity loyalty 
                    We then will evolve and grow from the tank of defi evolution & loans in the future.  
            I believe that investors around the world want a stable investment,
 that is fast and efficient they can transfer and hedge liquidity with less fees in less time seamlessly. 
              this is why $Shrk runs on Zilliqa’s blockchain to keep fees and friction to a minimum because as an investor you want maximum gains with maximum efficiency and 
minimum fees attached. 


What is Arbitrage? 

A second challenge for decentralized swapping systems is ensuring that the price ratio between each asset pair remains (relatively) consistent with the rest of the market. Each swap conducted using a given liquidity pool will result in a shift in the balance of the pool’s asset pair; the larger the swap, the bigger the resulting imbalance. Such an imbalance will give rise to an arbitrage opportunity: sharp-eyed traders with readily accessible stores of the relevant asset will be able to swoop in and swap the overvalued asset against the undervalued asset then sell the undervalued asset on other exchanges, turning a tidy profit. This process will repeat until the liquidity pool is once again balanced with the wider market. After a series of relatively large swaps and a return to fair market price, the total value in a given pool should always increase due to the fees collected on each swap.
                                     

APIs have replaced the whole paper process
      Digitalization & adoption of electronic payments

All funds are on the blockchain itself. This means that we do not control them. 


* We are committed to complete transparency *

Quantum Distributed ledger 
What we run on 
      Fin Tech

being that $Shrk runs on the backbone of Zilliqa's blockchain and that they utilize shard networks,
$Shrk is able to process multiple transactions in a decentralized manner without a trusted coordinator through distributed ledger & Its network architecture allows the platform to remain decentralized as it continues to grow and expand with Lowest fees!



Fees are usually correlated with network congestion and transaction backlogs. The fee market in legacy chains can push the costs to as high as a few dollars. Due to the scaling ability,and low fees on Zilliqa’s chain, even allowing micro-payments to be processed fast and efficiently. 


What about Security?
 

 Fear Nothing!!

 $SHRK runs on Zilliqa’s silicon smooth blockchain, that is actively working with Chainlink for an added security layer of security on top of the most secure blockchain. 
So 
$Shrk swims fast and efficiently 
 your sharks are safe. 
   Your sharks are decentralized! 
 100% unseasable Asset


$SHRK will swim in the wallets of the wealthy 
Fast and Efficiently 
   


Establishing Price*

looking at simple techniques to estimate the price for an asset. 
The more advanced economic mechanisms can open up new possibilities for the markets and can be very useful to let the market signal the price.
but that cannot apply in every scenario,considering we are in an evolving market  period 
 providers need to be able to set a reasonable price for their asset without a lot of information available to them.
With that being said! 

ROLES*
There are four key roles in the Fintech ecosystem:

Liquidity Providers * who are paid to provide liquidity

Swappers * who use the liquidity to swap assets paying fees

Traders * who monitor pools and rebalance continually, paying fees but with the intent to earn a profit.

Aribitors * Elite Traders that seek out price differences and maximize in proffits, also continuing to pay fees wile acquiring profit 


Disruption brings opportunity!!

We will disrupt decentralized finance and become the influence! 


Time Frame *
6 Phases 
In roadmap for $SHRK

Token allocation / inflation Tokenomics *

  420 million divided by 6 = main holders 70 million $Shrk in each main holders wallet 

Lock up 140 million for future developments unlocked in 3 years  

Top wallet address 70 million :    

1. Zil109vuy7hj9epl4zxse09vy6wrt04ytkcmw438zy
2. Zil1vtjutgxcgn75g7279ncflxk6gh9j8gshcav0hd
3. Zil1yeh7jpv20savtd3katuj9zk2hu57um75jdsysz
